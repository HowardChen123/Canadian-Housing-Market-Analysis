2,"The most typical of those offered by the major Chartered Banks."
3,"Prior to April 1973 the rates are averages of rates posted by major finance company participants in the market. From July 1966 to March 1973, the average was weighted by the amount of paper outstanding for each of the finance companies in the average; prior to that time it was unweighted. Between March 1973 and February 1979, the rate shown is the Bank of Canada's best estimate of operative market trading levels for major finance company paper borrowers."
7,"As of January 2019, the Bank of Canada will no longer publish the daily, weekly or monthly prime commercial paper (CP) or bankers’ acceptance (BA) rates. The 1- and 3-month transaction-based BA rates will be publicly available, for informational purposes only, on the website of the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (<a href="http://www.iiroc.ca/industry/marketmonitoringanalysis/Pages/BA-Rate.aspx">IIROC</a>) on a delayed basis. The historical data for these rates will continue to be available on the Bank of Canada website at the <a href="https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/interest-rates/">Selected Historical Interest Rates</a> page."
4,"Mid-market rates for typical quotes."
5,"Bank of Canada estimate at which investment dealers were able to arrange most of their overnight financing of money market inventory, excluding chartered bank day-to-day loans and purchase and resale agreements with the Bank of Canada. The rates are seven-day average for the week ending with the last Wednesday of the month."
6,"The yields refer to direct debt payable in Canadian dollars, excluding extendible issues and Canada Savings Bonds. Prior to 1975 some extendible issues are included but their inclusion does not materially affect the calculated average yields. Calculated from Wednesday mid-market closing prices."
