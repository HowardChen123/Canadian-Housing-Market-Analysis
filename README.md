## Canada's Housing Market: Where Are We Heading?

As COVID-19 spread in the early 2020, it quickly became a public health crisis and further led to an economic crisis. The Government of Canada has been successful in putting the pandemic under control through implementing various public health measures, as well as stabilizing the economy through stimulus programs. However, at the year of 2022, millions of people who don't own a house realizes that, the home price has risen to a point that it is far more unaffordable. Not only the average home price is at an all-time record, the average home price has increased by 46.5% in Canada in the past two years. For large cities such as Toronto and Vancouver, the average home price has broken through \$1 million.

To start with, there are two important things for readers to recognize. First, the house price growth over the pandemic is extremely uncommon. Second, the growth rate is unsustainable, since the earnings growth is not matching up. Therefore, it would be worth to understand the following questions whether you are a home buyer or an investor:

1.  What has happened in the COVID-19 pandemic that leads to such high house price growth?
2.  Where are we heading? What can we expect about the house price for the next few years?

In this research, we will be performing various data analysis to answer the research questions listed above.
